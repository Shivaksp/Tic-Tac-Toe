# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking X or O on a grid, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game's interface is designed with HTML and CSS, while JavaScript handles the logic for player moves, win conditions, and game state management.
